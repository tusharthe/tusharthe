## ✨ Quick intro

Software Engineer specializing in building product‑ready web and mobile applications. I focus on Laravel backends, Vue.js frontends, real‑time systems, and performant databases. I care deeply about clean architecture, readable code, and delivering delightful user experiences that scale.

Completed a postgraduate program in DevOps from Purdue University. As a freelancer, I have helped small businesses with AWS EC2 configuration and cloud setup.

Currently learning Python, data science, and AI/ML — building small projects to apply models, explore data pipelines, and level up in machine learning.

Find me building with Laravel, Vue, Node, and Flutter — open to collaborations and mentoring.

## 🛠 What I do

- **Backends:** Laravel APIs, OAuth/JWT, background jobs, queues and event-driven design.
- **Frontends:** Vue.js (SPA), progressive UX, real-time UI with WebSockets and broadcasting.
- **Mobile:** Flutter apps & hybrid prototypes.
- **Databases & performance:** MySQL / MongoDB, query tuning, indexes, caching.

## 🔭 Current focus

Building real-time features, developer-friendly APIs, and incremental UI improvements that scale. I love mentoring and improving code readability across teams.

## ✨ Add dynamic flair (copy & paste)

Below are safe, copy/paste snippets and small automations you can add to your README to keep it fresh and dynamic without embedding static numbers.

### 1) Live language / stat cards (dynamic)

```md
<!-- GitHub Readme Stats (dynamic, auto updates) -->
<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=tusharthe&show_icons=true&theme=transparent" alt="GitHub stats" />

<!-- Top languages (dynamic) -->
<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=tusharthe&layout=compact&theme=transparent" alt="Top languages" />
```

*These images update automatically as your repositories change — they are dynamic (not static counts you edit by hand).*

### 2) Recent activity graph (visual & live)

```md
<!-- Contribution graph visual -->
<img src="https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=tusharthe&area=true&hide_border=true" alt="activity graph" />
```

> Note: the graph automatically reflects your public contributions.

### 3) Show latest blog posts / notes (automatically)

Use a GitHub Action to fetch your blog RSS and inject latest posts into a README section. Add a placeholder in your README:

```md
<!-- BLOG:START -->
<!-- BLOG:END -->
```

Then set up an action (or small script) to replace that section with your latest posts (title + link). This keeps the README fresh without manual edits.

### 4) Auto-update pinned project highlights (example pattern)

You can run a weekly Action that updates a `FEATURED.md` and includes it into `README.md` via `<!-- PROJECTS:START -->` markers. This keeps a curated highlights list current.

---

## 💬 Want this on your repo? (quick steps)

1. Create a repo named `tusharthe` (if you haven’t already). Put this file in the repo as `README.md`.
2. Add the dynamic image snippets you like (stats, graph).
3. (Optional) Add a GitHub Action that pulls your blog RSS and replaces the `<!-- BLOG:START -->` block weekly.

If you want, I can supply ready-to-drop GitHub Action YAML for RSS -> README and a version of this README tuned for a dark theme.

## 🤝 Collaborate

- **Open to:** Laravel/Vue, MERN, and Flutter collabs
- **DM:** [@tkparial1](https://twitter.com/tkparial1)
- **Issues:** Open issues on any repo to discuss features/bugs

> Crafted as a clean, editable README — no hardcoded follower counts or static badges. If you want a dark-mode variant, more illustrations, or a live preview page, tell me which and I’ll create it.
